## Introduction

The Prediction of Diabetes project combines the power of machine learning algorithms and the Django web framework to create a predictive model for diabetes. By utilizing a dataset containing various medical attributes, the system can predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on the input provided.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting medical information.
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction.
- Display of prediction results to users.
- Data visualization to provide insights into the prediction model.
- Secure user authentication and authorization.
- User profile management.
